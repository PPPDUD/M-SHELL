# M-SHELL
M-SHELL is a free (as in freedom and also pricing) Python shell where its userbase does all of the work.
By default, each copy will provide one command: test.
The "test" command just says "hi".

To develop your own commands, save a Python file containing all of your code and name it with a .ms extension.
To install a command, download and run the supplied "M-SHELL Installer" and type in the name of the file or website where the command's definition is stored (e.g, "rickroll.ms")
