# M-SHELL
M-SHELL is a free (as in freedom and also pricing) Python shell where its userbase does all of the work.

By default, each copy will provide one command: test.
The "test" command just says "hi".

To develop your own commands, save a Python file containing all of your code and name it with a .ms extension.
To install a command, download and run the supplied "M-SHELL Installer" and type in the name of the file or website where the command's definition is stored (e.g, "rickroll.ms").

After installing a new command, your M-SHELL copy will require restarting for the changes to apply.

To uninstall a command, do the following steps:
1. Open the installer.
2. Type in the name of any command file (it won't affect the uninstallation).
3. Make the command name the name of the command you want to uninstall.
4. Confirm the uninstallation of the command by typing "Y" and pressing ENTER.

We welcome everyone to produce and provide commands for the community to utilize. A link to let you advertise your commands will be added shortly.
